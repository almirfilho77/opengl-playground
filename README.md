**The source code in this repository is written as I follow [TheCherno OpenGL series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2).**

The goal of this repository is entirely educational, as I'm learning graphics-related programming and improving my C++ knowledge along the way. It might look a lot like the code written in the series, but might as well contain my exploratory code (don't rely on it as a transcription of the code written by TheCherno).

As a modern OpenGL library, I'm using [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/).

Have fun! :smile:
